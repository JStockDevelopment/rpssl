# rpssl
RPSSL is a basic implementation of the class Big Bang Theory game Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. 10,000 games are played each time.


The game is set up with a basic Ant build. To run the program

1. Visit https://github.com/JStockDevelopment/rpssl
2. Download the zip file and extract the files. 
3. In the command line navigate to where you extracted the program (most likely in `rpssl-main`)
4. Run the command: `bash runProgram.sh`


Wins/Losses for each game option are preserved between program runs. To reset the program delete the losses.txt and wins.txt files.
